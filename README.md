**Python code as part of DXC technologies interview process

Question -- 
This exercise requires you to write a Python program to get it to display the first n Fibonacci numbers.
Note: The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . .
 
Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
Assuming n is set to 8 the following Fibonacci sequence should be displayed -> 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13
Include details on how to run the program when submitting your work.
Extra consideration will be given to candidates who also include a unit test for the program with appropriate instructions on how to run the test.




**Steps to run the code.**

1. Copy the code from 'main.py' file.
2. Load the copied code into online python compiler. 'https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_compiler'
3. Execute the code.

**Note: Code is explained in the 'main.py' file.

Unit testing results is attached below.
